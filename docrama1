You have an unusual magnetic personality.  Don't walk too close to
metal objects which are not fastened down.
You feel a whole lot more like you do now than you did when you used to.
Q:	Where's the Lone Ranger take his garbage?
A:	To the dump, to the dump, to the dump dump dump!

Q:	What's the Pink Panther say when he steps on an ant hill?
A:	Dead ant, dead ant, dead ant dead ant dead ant...
I've touch'd the highest point of all my greatness;
And from that full meridian of my glory
I haste now to my setting.  I shall fall,
Like a bright exhalation in the evening
And no man see me more.
		-- Shakespeare
This night methinks is but the daylight sick.
		-- William Shakespeare, "The Merchant of Venice"
